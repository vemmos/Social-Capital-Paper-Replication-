## Summary
In this paper, I familiriazed myself with the term of Economic Connectedness (EC), which basically means the degree to which people with low and high Socioeconomic Status (SES) are friends with each other. The paper shows that EC, which here is calculated for each state in the US, can have a great influence on the people's probability of upwards socioeconomic advancement.
